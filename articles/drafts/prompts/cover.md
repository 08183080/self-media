A cinematic Matrix-inspired cover image for an article about building products for AI agents.

Visual concept: A dark, deep green-black cyberpunk scene. Cascading green digital rain (Matrix code rain) flows from the top, but as it descends, the characters morph and transform into recognizable terminal commands, CLI prompts, and code snippets — symbols like `>_`, `$ git`, `mcp://`, `skills/`, `*.md`.

At the center, a luminous terminal window floats in the void, glowing with soft green-on-black text. The terminal displays a blinking cursor, representing the AI agent at work. Around it, translucent holographic tool icons (CLI, Markdown files, gear symbols, connection nodes) orbit like satellites, all connected by flowing green data streams.

The overall mood is dramatic and powerful — the old technology (CLI, plain text) being reborn as the infrastructure of the AI agent era. Deep blacks, electric greens (#00FF41), with subtle teal highlights.

Style: Cinematic digital art, Matrix aesthetic, high contrast, dark atmosphere with glowing elements. No realistic human faces or figures — only silhouettes or abstract forms if any human presence is implied.

MUST include the Chinese title "2026，为智能体而造" rendered in a bold display font at the bottom or center of the image, integrated naturally into the design. The text should feel like it's part of the digital world — perhaps with a subtle glow effect.

MUST include watermark text "与龙邂逅" in a subtle, small position (bottom-right corner).
