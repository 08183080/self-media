# Text Elements
Title: "7条与AI智能体协作的法则"

# Mood Application
Use high contrast, vivid saturated colors on dark background, heavy visual weight, dynamic energy

# Font Application
Use bold decorative display typography. Heavy, expressive headlines. Chinese characters should be bold and impactful.

# Composition
Type composition:
- Abstract shapes representing human-AI synergy and collaboration
- Information hierarchy with clear focal point

Visual composition:
- Main visual: A human silhouette and an AI/robot silhouette facing each other, connected by flowing data streams and energy lines forming the number "7" between them. The two figures stand as equals, not as master and tool.
- Layout: Central symmetric composition, figures on left and right, the number "7" formed by the connecting energy in the center
- Decorative: Geometric circuit patterns, floating code brackets, neural network nodes scattered in the dark background
- Color highlights: Electric blue (#00D4FF) and warm amber (#FF8C00) energy streams on deep dark (#0A0E1A) background

Color scheme: Deep navy-black #0A0E1A background, electric cyan #00D4FF primary, warm amber #FF8C00 accent, soft white #E8E8E8 for text
Rendering notes: Clean flat vector shapes, no gradients within shapes, sharp edges, minimal line work, bold geometric forms
Type notes: Abstract conceptual shapes, clear information zones, balanced visual weight
Palette notes: Dark palette with high-contrast accent colors, tech-forward aesthetic

Include a subtle watermark "与龙邂逅" positioned at bottom-right corner.
The watermark should be legible but not distracting from the main content.
