# Cover Image: Claude Code AI Programming Partner

## Visual Concept

Create a conceptual cover image representing AI as a programming partner. The design should convey:
- **Collaboration between human and AI** in software development
- **Efficiency and automation** through AI assistance
- **Modern technology** and cutting-edge tools
- **Professional yet approachable** tone

## Core Visual Elements

MUST include these key elements with clear integration:

1. **AI Assistant Metaphor** (REQUIRED)
   - Abstract geometric representation of AI (NOT realistic human)
   - Suggest intelligence through glowing nodes, neural patterns, or flowing data streams
   - Position: Right side or floating near center

2. **Code/Programming Symbols** (REQUIRED)
   - Simplified code brackets `< >`, terminal cursor `_`, or abstract code lines
   - Flat vector style, minimal detail
   - Integration: Scattered around or emanating from AI element

3. **Collaboration Visual** (REQUIRED)
   - Suggest human-AI partnership through:
     - Connecting lines or data flow between elements
     - Shared workspace metaphor (split screen, dual panels)
     - Hand silhouette + AI element working together
   - MUST be abstract, NO realistic human faces

## Color Palette (Cool)

- **Primary**: Deep blues (#2563EB, #1E40AF)
- **Accent**: Cyan/teal (#06B6D4, #0891B2) for tech vibrancy
- **Highlight**: Light blue (#DBEAFE) for contrast
- **Background**: Clean white or very light blue (#F0F9FF)

## Composition

- **Layout**: Horizontal 16:9, asymmetric balance
- **Whitespace**: 50% breathing room (left or top)
- **Visual anchor**: Main AI element positioned slightly off-center right
- **Title placement**: Left side or bottom, ample space around text
- **Depth**: Subtle layering through transparency and overlap

## Rendering Style (Flat Vector)

- Clean geometric shapes with sharp edges
- Solid color fills, NO gradients (or minimal linear gradients)
- Line work: 2-4px stroke weight, consistent style
- Icons/symbols: Simple, recognizable, high contrast
- Overall: Modern, professional, Microsoft/Google design language

## Text Integration

- **Title**: "Claude Code：让 AI 成为你的编程搭档"
- **Font**: Clean sans-serif (similar to Inter, SF Pro, Noto Sans SC for Chinese)
- **Weight**: Medium to Bold (600-700)
- **Size**: Large enough to read clearly (约占画面 15-20% 高度)
- **Color**: Dark blue (#1E3A8A) or white (depending on background)
- **Position**: Left side with padding, or bottom with centered alignment
- **Chinese characters**: Ensure proper spacing and legibility

## Watermark

- **Text**: "与龙邂逅"
- **Position**: Bottom right corner
- **Style**: Small, subtle, semi-transparent (30-40% opacity)
- **Font**: Match title font, smaller size

## Mood (Balanced)

- **Contrast**: Medium - readable but not harsh
- **Energy**: Professional yet dynamic
- **Tone**: Approachable technology, NOT intimidating

## Key Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Each element serves a clear purpose
2. **Clarity**: Immediate understanding of "AI + Programming"
3. **Professional**: Suitable for tech article cover
4. **Modern**: Contemporary flat design aesthetic
5. **Breathing room**: Generous whitespace, not crowded

## What to AVOID

- ❌ Realistic human faces or detailed portraits
- ❌ Overly complex technical diagrams
- ❌ Busy backgrounds or patterns
- ❌ Too many colors (stick to 3-4 max)
- ❌ Gradients or 3D effects (flat vector style)
- ❌ Small, unreadable text or icons
- ❌ Cliché stock photo aesthetics

## Reference Style

Think: Stripe blog covers, GitHub social cards, Figma feature announcements - clean, conceptual, instantly recognizable.
